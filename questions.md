<h2>Write about how you plan to use what you learned in this lesson to improve your CPT project.</h2>

I plan to utilize the information on styling and css to make the CPT better so I can earn a better grade in the class and become a better coder.

To style my project, I'd put the Bootstrap resource in my HTML <head> tag. Then, I could use classes like container from Bootstrap to help me style things. It's a quick and easy way to make things look nice without having to do all the hard work myself.

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>

Good wireframes need to be simple and focused on the user. They should show how things work and be easy to make in code. When making a wireframe, you have to think about making it look good and making it easy for people to use so they can focus on what's important.

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>

User testing is really important when it comes to designing a user interface because, well, it's meant for the user! One way websites test their design is by using A/B testing. They try out different stuff on some people and see if it works better or not (like if people click more). If it works better, they use it for everyone.

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>

Bootstrap is like a shortcut for developers who don't want to spend time making their own styling from scratch. It's a library of CSS classes they can use to make their websites look cool without having to do all the work themselves.

<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>

Bootstrap is CSS. I'm assuming you're referring to the practice of rolling your own CSS. By leveraging Bootstrap classes, the developer can save valuable time and instead use it for actual content development.

<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>

All you have to do is put the resource in your HTML <head> tag and then add classes to the HTML elements you want to use them on.

<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>

Selectors let you pick one thing or a bunch of things in your HTML code by looking for a specific thing about them, like a "class" attribute. So, if you use the .test selector, it would style all the elements with the "test" class. It's a handy way to style lots of things at once.

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>

In the code, the programmer used an if statement to see if the snake goes off the edge of the screen (Line 60). They also used a forEach loop to go through each of the snake's cells and draw them on the canvas in the right place (Line 85). It's a smart way to make sure everything is working the way it should be.

<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>

The :root selector is used to create CSS variables that you can use anywhere else in your code. It's like giving a name to a color or font, so you can use it over and over again without having to remember the exact value. It's a really handy trick to make your code look clean and organized.

<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>

When making a website, you use HTML to put all the pieces in the right places, CSS to make everything look good and neat, and JavaScript to make things move around or do things when someone clicks on them. Each of these languages has its own way of writing code. HTML is like a blueprint, CSS is like putting paint and decorations on the blueprint, and JavaScript is like adding smart features to the blueprint.
